    <h3><p>Application web development refers to the process of creating interactive, functional, and user-friendly web applications that run on browsers. It involves both frontend development, which focuses on the user interface, and backend development, which handles data processing, server logic, and database management. Modern web app development often uses technologies like React, Angular, Node.js, Django, and various cloud services to build scalable and efficient applications. The goal is to deliver smooth performance, strong security, and a seamless user experience across different devices and platforms.</p></h3>
