    <h1>Project 1</h1>
    <h3>
        <p>The web frontend is the part of a website that users can directly see and interact with. It uses HTML to structure the content, CSS to design and style the layout, and JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic features. The main goal of frontend development is to create a fast, responsive, and user-friendly interface that works smoothly on both mobile and desktop devices. Modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular make this process even more powerful and efficient, helping developers build complex web applications with greater ease.    </p>
